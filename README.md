TicTacToe:
This age old game of TicTacToe.


How its made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, Javascript
Using factory functions to store and work with object methods is a new concept for me and ive tried to implement that as much as possible in this project.


Lessons learned:
I need to focus more on reusable code, rather than fixing one problem at a time per function.
